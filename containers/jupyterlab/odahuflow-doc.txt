 odahuflow Python toolchain container
===================================

Main aim of this container - to provide you a way to run your model training on local machine.

1. To run jupyter lab use "jupyter lab" command
2. To run jupyter notebook use "jupyter notebook" command
3. To run custom python script use "python3 <script>"

During training you have to call odahuflow.model functions and call odahuflow.model.save() at the end of script.
After odahuflow.model.save() invocation your binary-serialized models will be stored inside container file-system.
To make docker-image from your model you have to run "odahuflowctl build" inside your container.
